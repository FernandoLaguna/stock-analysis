# stock-analysis
## Overview of the project

The main objective of this challenge is to shorten the time of processing the stocks. This necessity arose, because SteveÂ´s parents want to expand the amount of data in the analysis and our current code will take a long to process all the information.

Therefore, we are going to refactor the code that we did before, in order to make it smoother.
